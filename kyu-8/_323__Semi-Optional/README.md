## üìù Description

We have implemented a function wrap(value) that takes a value of arbitrary type and wraps it in a new JavaScript Object or Python Dict setting  the 'value' key on the new Object or Dict to the passed-in value.

So, for example, if we execute the following code:

```python 
wrapper_obj = wrap("my_wrapped_string"); 
 # wrapper_obj should be  {"value":"my_wrapped_string"}
```


We would then expect the following statement to be true:

```python
wrapper_obj["value"] == "my_wrapped_string"
```

Unfortunately, the code is not working as designed. Please fix the code so that it behaves as specified.
