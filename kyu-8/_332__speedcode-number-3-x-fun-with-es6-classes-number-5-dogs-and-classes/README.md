# SpeedCode #3 × Fun with ES6 Classes #5 - Dogs and Classes

## Objective

Preloaded for you is a ```class Dog```:

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = species;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = size;
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = loyal;
  }
}
```

You are then given a working ```class Labrador``` as your initial code.

```javascript
class Labrador {
  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = "Labrador";
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = "Large";
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = true;
  }
}
```

**Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.**

Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself.  Are you ready?  Ready, get set, GO!!! :D
