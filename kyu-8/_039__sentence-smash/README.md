## 📝 Description

# Sentence Smash

Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. **Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!**

## Example

```
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
```

## Assumptions

* You can assume that you are only given words.
* You cannot assume the size of the array.
* You can assume that you do get an array.

## What We're Testing

We're testing basic loops and string manipulation. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and string manipulation.

## Disclaimer

This is for beginners so we want to test basic loops and string manipulation. Advanced users should easily be able to do this in one line.
