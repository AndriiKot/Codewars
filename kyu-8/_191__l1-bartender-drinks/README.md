## üìù Description

Complete the function that receives as input a string, and produces outputs according to the following table:

| Input | Output
| ----  | ------
| "Jabroni" | "Patron Tequila"
| "School Counselor" | "Anything with Alcohol"
| "Programmer" | "Hipster Craft Beer"
| "Bike Gang Member" | "Moonshine"
| "Politician" | "Your tax dollars"
| "Rapper" | "Cristal"
| *anything else* | "Beer"

**Note:** *anything else* is the default case: if the input to the function is not any of the values in the table, then the return value should be `"Beer"`.

Make sure you cover the cases where certain words do not show up with correct capitalization. For example, the input `"pOLitiCIaN"` should still return `"Your tax dollars"`.
