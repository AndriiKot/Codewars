## 📝 Description

Your task is to find the nearest square number of a positive integer `n`. In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

For example, if `n = 111`, then the nearest square number equals 121, since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10.

If `n` is already a perfect square (e.g. `n = 144`, `n = 81`,  etc.), you need to just return `n`.

Good luck :)
