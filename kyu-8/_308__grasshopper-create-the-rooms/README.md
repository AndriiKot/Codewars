## 📝 Description

# Escape the room

You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table ( `dict` in Python) called `rooms` that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each room being a hash table with at least 3 properties (e.g. `name`, `description`, `completed`).
