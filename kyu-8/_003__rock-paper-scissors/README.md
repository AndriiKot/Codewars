## 📝 Description

Rules of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game are:
- Rock beats Scissors,
- Scissors beat Paper,
- Paper beats Rock,
- Two identical moves are a draw.

Let's play! You will be given valid moves of two Rock, Paper, Scissors players, and have to return which player won: `"Player 1 won!"` for player 1, and `"Player 2 won!"` for player 2. In case of a draw return `Draw!`.

"scissors",     "rock"      --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper",        "paper"     --> "Draw!"
