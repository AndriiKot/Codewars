## 📝 Description

Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

If no occurrences can be found, a count of `0` should be returned.

```js
("Hello", 'o')  =>  1
("Hello", 'l')  =>  2
("", 'z')       =>  0
```

### Notes

* The first argument can be an empty string
* In languages with no distinct character data type, the second argument will be a string of length `1`
