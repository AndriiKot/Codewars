Task

Given a table where users' 
connections are logged, 
find the first and the last address 
of the networks they connected from.

Notes

Order the result by the id column
There's no need to validate anything - 
it's okay if the user connects from a private network
(You don't need the connection_time field 
for this task but without it the input data looks too dull)
You can read more about IPv4 on Wikipedia
(check the First and last subnet addresses section 
if you need an example/explanation related to this task only)
