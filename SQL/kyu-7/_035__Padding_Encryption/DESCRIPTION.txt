The Dunning-Kruger effect is 
a cognitive bias in which 
people wrongly overestimate 
their knowledge or ability in 
a specific area. This tends 
to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their skills.

Assume you have a PostgreSQL 
database with a table named "users". 
The "users" table has the following columns:

id (integer): a unique identifier for each user.
name (text): the name of the user.
perceived_skill_level (integer): the user's self-assessed skill level, from 1 to 10.
actual_skill_level (integer): the user's actual skill level, measured objectively, from 1 to 10.
Your task is to write an SQL query that does the following:

Selects only those users 
where the perceived skill level is greater than the actual skill level.
For each of these users, calculates 
the difference between 
the perceived skill level and actual skill level as "skill_overestimation".
Adds a "overconfidence_category" message based on the degree of skill overestimation*
'Mild case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is 2 or less
'Moderate case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is greater than 2 and up to 5
'Serious case of overconfidence': skill overestimation is greater than 5 and up to 7
'Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!': skill overestimation is more than 7
You should return the following columns:

id: A unique identifier for each user. 
Used for sorting if overconfidence levels are equal.
name: The user's name. Included for easy identification of each result.
skill_overestimation: 
The computed difference 
between a user's perceived and actual skill levels. It measures the degree of overconfidence.
overconfidence_category: 
categorization of overconfidence, as described above
The query should order the 
result first by skill 
overestimation in descending order, and in the case of a tie, by user id in descending order.

To make a task a bit funnier, 
for random tests, 
I scrapped the usernames 
of the current top 100 Codewars users -
let's see which of the Codewars stars have an extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect :-)

GLHF!

Desired Output
The desired output should look like this:

id  name    skill_overestimation    overconfidence_category
98  dcieslak    9   Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!
95  dinglemouse 9   Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!
69  monadius    8   Extreme case of Dunning-Kruger effect detected!
