Write a function that takes a positive 
integer n, sums all the cubed values 
from 1 to n (inclusive), and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

Examples: (Input --> output)

2 --> 9 (sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8)
3 --> 36 (sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27)


-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'cubes' with column 'n' (bigint)
-- return a query with column 'n' and your 
-- result in a column named 'res' (bigint)
-- sort results by column 'n' ascending
