DESCRIPTION:
There is truly no magic in the world; the 
Hogwarts Sorting Hat is SQL-based, its 
decision-making powers are common operators 
and prospectIve students are merely data - names, 
and two columns of qualities.

students

id
name
quality1
quality2

Slytherin are being quite strict 
this year and will only take students 
who are evil AND cunning.
Gryffindor will take students who are 
brave but only if their second quality is NOT evil.
Ravenclaw accepts students who are 
studious OR intelligent.
Hufflepuff will simply take those 
who have the quality hufflepuff.

(don't worry, for simplicity's sake 
'brave' and 'studious' will only appear in quality1, 
and 'cunning' and 'intelligent' will only appear in quality2.)

Return the id, name, quality1 and quality2 
of all the students who'll be accepted, ordered by ascending id.
