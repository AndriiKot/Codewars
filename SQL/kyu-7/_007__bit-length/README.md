## 📝 Description

In this kata you have to return the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. 

#### examples

```python
bit_length(0) >> 0   # binary : 0
bit_length(1) >> 1   # binary : 1 
bit_length(10) >> 4  # binary : 1010 
bit_length(12) >> 4  # binary : 1100
bit_length(100) >> 7 # binary : 1100100
bit_length(-1) >> 1  # binary : -1
```

#### Note 

-10^10 <= n <= 10^10
