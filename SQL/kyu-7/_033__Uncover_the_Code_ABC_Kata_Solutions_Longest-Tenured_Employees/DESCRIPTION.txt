In celebration of ABC Kata Solutions' anniversary, 
we focus on the pillars of an organization: 
longest-serving and currently active employees. 
This SQL challenge involves uncovering a hidden 
code derived from the first letters of the names 
of the top 5 longest-tenured employees who are 
still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.

Craft an SQL query to discover a hidden code by summing 
the ASCII values of the first letters of the last 
names of the top five oldest (longest-tenured) 
employees who are still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.


You have access to an employees table in ABC Kata Solutions'database, which includes:


id (integer) - Unique identifier for each employee.
name (string) - Full name of the employee, formatted as "firstName lastName".
joined_date (date) - The date the employee began their employment with ABC Kata Solutions.
left_date (date, nullable) - 
The date the employee ended their employment with ABC Kata Solutions, if applicable.
Requirements:


Identify the Top 5 Oldest Current Employees: 
Find the five employees with the longest 
tenure at ABC Kata Solutions who are still employed (i.e., their left_date is NULL).
Extract the First Letter of the Last Name: 
From each employee's name, extract the first letter of the last name.
Calculate ASCII Values: Convert these letters to their ASCII values.
Sum the Values: Sum the ASCII values to derive the hidden code.
Present the Result: Display the final sum as hidden_code.


Notes:
Let's assume for this task that there are no employees 
with the same joined_date - tests are written to ensure 
that no two employees have the same date of join.
For this sample data:
