You are given a table 
random\_string 
that has the following format:

random_string schema
text
The text field holds 
a single row which contains a random string.

Your task is to take 
the random string and 
split it on each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) 
then the resultant 
substrings will be 
contained in the output table, formatted as:

output table schema
results
Note that the vowels should be removed.

If there are no vowels, 
there will only be one row returned. 
Where there are multiple 
vowels in succession, 
you will see empty rows. 
A row should be created 
on each break, 
whether there is content in the row or not.

Regex is advised but not mandatory.
