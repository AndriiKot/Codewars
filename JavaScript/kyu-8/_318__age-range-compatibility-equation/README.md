## üìù Description

Everybody knows the classic ["half your age plus seven"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships#%22Half-your-age-plus-seven%22_rule) dating rule that a lot of people follow (including myself). It's the 'recommended' age range in which to date someone.

* `$\text{Min} = \dfrac{ \text{Age} } {2} + 7$`

* `$\text{Max} = 2 \cdot (\text{Age - 7})$`

* `$\text{Minimum age} \le \text{Your age} \le \text{Maximum age}$`


## Task

Given an integer (1 <= n <= 100) representing a person's age, return their minimum and maximum age range.

This equation doesn't work when the age <= 14, so if the age <= 14, use this equation instead:

```
min = age - 0.10 * age
max = age + 0.10 * age
```

You should floor all your answers so that an integer is given instead of a float (which doesn't represent age). Return your answer in the form ```"[min]-[max]"```


## Examples:

```
age = 27   =>   "20-40"
age = 5    =>   "4-5"
age = 17   =>   "15-20"
```
