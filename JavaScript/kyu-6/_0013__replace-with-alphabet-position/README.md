## üìù Description

Welcome.

In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

`"a" = 1`, `"b" = 2`, etc.

## Example

```
Input = "The sunset sets at twelve o' clock."
Output = "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"
```
