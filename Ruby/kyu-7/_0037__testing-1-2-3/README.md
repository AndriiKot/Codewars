## 📝 Description

Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is `n: string`. Notice the colon and space in between.

**Examples: (Input --> Output)**

```
[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]
```
