## üìù Description

Implement a function that computes the difference between two lists. The function should remove all occurrences of elements from the first list (`a`) that are present in the second list (`b`). The order of elements in the first list should be preserved in the result.

## Examples

If `a = [1, 2]` and `b = [1]`, the result should be `[2]`.

If `a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` and `b = [2]`, the result should be `[1, 3]`.

``` if:c
## NOTE: 

In C, assign return array length to pointer `*z`
```
