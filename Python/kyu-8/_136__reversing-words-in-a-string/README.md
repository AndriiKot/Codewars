## 📝 Description

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. Words are always separated by a single space.

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

Example (**Input** --> **Output**)

```
"Hello World" --> "World Hello"
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi"
```

Happy coding!
