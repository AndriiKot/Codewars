Description:
Given a set of numbers, 
return the additive inverse of each. 
Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] --> [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
[1, -2, 3, -4, 5] --> [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
[] --> []

You can assume that all values are integers. 
Do not mutate the input array.
