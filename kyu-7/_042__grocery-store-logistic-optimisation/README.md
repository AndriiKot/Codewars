You have reached a conclusion that you waste to much time because you have to many different warehouse to visit each week. 

You have to find out how many different type of products you buy from each producer. If you take only few items from some of them you will stop going there to save the gasoline:)

Order the result by `count_products_types` (DESC) then by `producer` (ASC) in case there are duplicate amounts,

### results table schema

_Note: there has been a critical change in the description and the column names long after the approval/publication of the kata so don't be surprised if you see solutions with different column names once you solved the kata (solutions weren't revalidated after the change because their was already too much of them)._
