## üìù Description

## Task

Given a table where users' connections are logged, find the first and the last address of the networks they connected from.

## Notes
* Order the result by the `id` column
* There's no need to validate anything - it's okay if the user connects from a private network
* (You don't need the `connection_time` field for this task but without it the input data looks too dull)
* You can read more about IPv4 [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (check the [First and last subnet addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#First_and_last_subnet_addresses) section if you need an example/explanation related to this task only)
