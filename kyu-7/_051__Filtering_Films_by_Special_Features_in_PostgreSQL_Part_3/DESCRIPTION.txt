Description:
Write a PostgreSQL query that selects film_id, 
the title and special_features columns from the film table 
in the DVD rental database, 
and returns films that have either 
"Deleted Scenes" or "Behind the Scenes" as a special feature, 
but not both - meaning that if there are "Deleted Scenes", 
there should not be "Behind the Scenes" and vice versa. 
The query should also exclude films that have "Commentaries" as a special feature.

Notes:
for the sample tests, static dump of DVD Rental Sample Database is used, 
for the final solution - random tests.
The result should be order by title alphabetically, 
if title is the same - then by film_id in asc order.
special_features is the text[] type. It represents a one-dimensional 
array of values, where each value is of the text data type.

Schema:
film table:

Column            | Type      | Modifiers
------------------+-----------+-----------
film_id           | integer   | not null
title             | varchar   | not null
description       | text      | not null
release_year      | integer   | not null
language_id       | integer   | not null 
rental_duration   | integer   | not null
rental_rate       | numeric   | not null
length            | integer   | not null
replacement_cost  | numeric   | not null
rating            | varchar   | not null
last_update       | timestamp | not null
special_features  | text[]    | not null


Desired Output
The desired output should look like this:


film_id | title                             | special_features                       |
--------+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
