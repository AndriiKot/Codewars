## üìù Description

In celebration of ABC Kata Solutions' anniversary, we focus on the pillars of an organization: longest-serving and currently active employees. This SQL challenge involves uncovering a hidden code derived from the first letters of the names of the top 5 longest-tenured employees who are still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.

Craft an SQL query to discover a hidden code by summing the ASCII values of the first letters of the last names of the top five oldest (longest-tenured) employees who are still actively contributing to ABC Kata Solutions.

You have access to an `employees` table in ABC Kata Solutions'database, which includes:

* `id` (integer) - Unique identifier for each employee.
* `name` (string) - Full name of the employee, formatted as "firstName lastName".
* `joined_date` (date) - The date the employee began their employment with ABC Kata Solutions.
* `left_date` (date, nullable) - The date the employee ended their employment with ABC Kata Solutions, if applicable.

Requirements:

1) Identify the Top 5 Oldest Current Employees: Find the five employees with the longest tenure at ABC Kata Solutions who are still employed (i.e., their `left_date` is NULL).
2) Extract the First Letter of the Last Name: From each employee's name, extract the first letter of the last name.
3) Calculate ASCII Values: Convert these letters to their ASCII values.
4) Sum the Values: Sum the ASCII values to derive the hidden code.
5) Present the Result: Display the final sum as `hidden_code`.

##### Notes:

*  Let's assume for this task that there are no employees with the same `joined_date` - tests are written to ensure that no two employees have the same date of join. 

For this sample data:

```
| id | name             | joined_date | left_date  |
+----+------------------+-------------+------------+
| 1  | Bob Anderson     | 2015-04-23  | NULL       |
| 2  | Alice Brown      | 2016-05-20  | NULL       |
| 3  | David Chapman    | 2017-06-15  | NULL       |
| 4  | Charlie Dinklage | 2014-07-30  | NULL       |
| 5  | Frank Evans      | 2015-08-25  | NULL       |
| 6  | Eve Fitch        | 2014-06-11  | 2019-10-01 |
| 7  | Hannah Grimes    | 2014-12-03  | 2020-03-15 |
| 8  | Grace Hart       | 2018-01-20  | NULL       |
| 9  | Julia Ingram     | 2019-03-17  | NULL       |
| 10 | Ian James        | 2020-04-15  | NULL       |
| 11 | Luna Knox        | 2021-05-22  | NULL       |
| 12 | Karl Lovegood    | 2022-06-30  | NULL       |
| 13 | Milo Murphy      | 2023-07-05  | NULL       |
```

the desired output is the following:

<table><!----><tr><th>hidden_code</th></tr><tr><td>335</td></tr></table>

From the sorted list of those employees who still working at ABC Kata Solutions, the top 5 oldest employees based on their join dates are:

1) Charlie Dinklage (2014-07-30)
2) Bob Anderson (2015-04-23)
3) Frank Evans (2015-08-25)
4) Alice Brown (2016-05-20)
5) David Chapman (2017-06-15)

We extract the first letter of each of their last names, and sum the ASCII values of these letters:

`hidden_code` = 68 (D) + 65 (A) + 69 (E) + 66 (B) + 67 (C) = 335

GLHF!
