You are given a table with the following format:

** encryption table schema **

md5
sha1
sha256

Problem is the table looks so unbalanced - 
the sha256 column contains much longer strings. 
You need to balance things up. Add '1' 
to the end of the md5 addresses as many 
times as you need to to make them the same 
length as those in the sha256 column. 
Add '0' to the beginning of the sha1 values to achieve the same result.

Return as:

** output table schema **

md5
sha1
sha256
