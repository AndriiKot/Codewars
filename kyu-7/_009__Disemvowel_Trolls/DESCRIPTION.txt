Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation 
is to remove all of the vowels from the 
trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that 
takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website 
is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'disemvowel' 
-- with column 'str', return a table with 
-- column 'str' and your result in a column named 'res'.
