You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

** monsters table schema **

id
name
legs
arms
characteristics

Your task is to make a new table 
where each column should contain 
the length of the string in the column 
to its right (last column should 
contain length of string in the first column). 
Remember some column values are not currently strings. 
Column order and titles should remain unchanged:

** output table schema **

id
name
legs
arms
characteristics
