Assume both the given number and 
the number of times to count will 
be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples
countBy(1,10)  should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  should return {2,4,6,8,10}

-- you are given a table 'counter' with columns 'x' (int) and 'n' (int)
-- return a query with columns 'x', 'n' and your result in 
--a column named 'res' (array)
-- sort results by column 'x' ascending, then by 'n' ascending
-- note that each pair of 'x' and 'n' in 'counter' is unique
