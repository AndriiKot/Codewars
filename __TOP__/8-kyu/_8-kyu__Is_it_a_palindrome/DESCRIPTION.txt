Write a function that checks 
if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, number, 
phrase, or other sequence of 
symbols that reads the same 
backwards as forwards, 
such as madam or racecar.

-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'ispalindrome' 
-- with column 'str', return a table with 
-- column 'str' and your result 
-- in a column named 'res'.
